# CLint: Conventional commits linter

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

`CLint` is a command line tool that allows you to validate messages related to git commits in different ways, ensuring
that the message is [Conventional Commits compliant](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification).

## Technologies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7.2+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Installation

While the implementation is still in alpha state, the only way to install `CLint` will be through `pip` (or tools
like `poetry` and `pipenv`).

```sh
# Install with pip
$ pip install clint-cli

# Install with poetry
$ poetry add clint-cli

# Install with pipenv
$ pipenv install clint-cli
```

## Key features

- Validate a commit message in the command line.
- Allow to handle git `commit-msg` hook.

## Planned features

- Validate a commit message in the command line through pipes.
- Make [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) compatible.
- Allow to build a commit message through command line prompts.

## Usage examples

```sh
# Validate a sample message
$ clint "feat(scope): validate this message"
Your commit message is CC compliant!
```

```sh
# Validation error for invalid type (typo)
$ clint "feta(scope): validate this message"
Validation error: Type 'feta' is not valid.
```

```sh
# Enable git hook on /path/to/repo
$ clint --enable-hook
Enable hook: Hook enabled at /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/commit-msg
```

```sh
# Disable git hook on /path/to/repo
$ clint --disable-hook
Disable hook: Hook disabled at /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/commit-msg
```

## Project status

`CLint` is currently under active development. The goal is to achieve at least the [planned features](#planned-features)
, and then continue maintaining the code, making it compatible with future versions of Python and the libraries used in
the project.

## Source

`CLint` tries to be what other tools already are, like the
great [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint). The difference
with [similar tools](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/#tooling-for-conventional-commits) is that those are
built over `Node.js`, so they are focused on `Javascript` developers. If you are not, you will be forced to
install `Node.js` anyway in order to use those tools.

## License

`CLint` is distributed under the [GPL v3 license](../COPYING).
